[Source](https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/what-is-devshm-and-its-practical-usage.html):

`/dev/shm`: is nothing but implementation of traditional shared memory concept. It is an efficient means of passing data between programs. One program will create a memory portion, which other processes (if permitted) can access. This will result into speeding up things on Linux.

`shm / shmfs`: is also known as tmpfs, which is a common name for a temporary file storage facility on many Unix-like operating systems. It is intended to appear as a mounted file system, but one which uses virtual memory instead of a persistent storage device.

So from the above the applications using the `/dev/shm` must be doing _in house_ cleaning as they add and remove data as needed. `/run/shm -> /dev/shm`: is an implementation of `tmpfs` done by Debian, where `/run/shm` replaces old style `/dev/shm` so no hassles here.
