   Packet Driver

   Introduction:
   -------------
   This document describes the procedure to setup the Packet driver for
   REALTEK RTS8029 PCI fast ethernet card.

   Location of Driver:     \PCIPKT\PCIPKT.COM

   Sample Configuration Files:
   ---------------------------
      AUTOEXEC.BAT
        PCIPKT 0x60

   Notes:
   ------
     1.  Load the packet driver using the software interrupt and any
         optional switches if required.

         Usage: PCIPKT [options] <software_int_no> [bus_no device_no]

         Example: PCIPKT -i 0x60 0x00 0x0A

         The only required  parameter is the software interrupt.  A packet
         driver needs to have a software interrupt assigned to it for other
         programs to access it. The recommended interrupt 0x7e. If you need
         any of the  options  listed below,  place them before the software
         interrupt on the command line.

         -i - Force driver to report itself as 802.3 instead of Ethernet II.
         -d - Delayed initialization.  Used for diskless booting
         -n - NetWare conversion.  Converts 802.3 packets into 8137 packets
         -w - Windows hack, obsoleted by winpkt
         -p - Promiscuous mode disable
         -u - Uninstall

      2. Type command,C:\PCIPKT 0x60, the screen will appear following
         message:

         System: [345]86 processor, PCI bus, Two 8259s
         Packet driver software interrupt is 0x60
         Interrupt number is 0x9
         I/O port is 0x6100
         My Ethernet address is 52:54:4C:29:29:AD

      3. Installing Multiple LAN Adapters:

         3.1 The user can run PCIPKT 0x60 directly, then the screen
             will display :

             Packet driver for RTL8029, PCI version 1.1
             Copyright 2000(c), Realtek Semiconductor Inc.

             There are 2 network cards on your main board :
             Card 1. IRQ= 0x9  I/O= 0x6100  NodeID= 52:54:4C:29:29:AD
             Card 2. IRQ= 0xA  I/O= 0x6000  NodeID= 52:54:4C:29:29:64
             Please select a Card No.(1-2): 1

         3.11 The user just has to select one card from the list. After
             selecting Card 1, the screen will display:

             System: [345]86 processor, PCI bus, Two 8259s
             Packet driver software interrupt is 0x60
             Interrupt number is 0x9
             I/O port is 0x6100
             My Ethernet address is 52:54:4C:29:29:AD

         3.2 The user can use the bus_no and device_no argument to specify
             the card that you want to select. If bus number is 0x00 and
             the device number is 0x0A, you just has bo type
             PCIPKT 0x60 0x00 0x0A in the command line to select this card
             directly without having to make selection as 3.1.

      4. Installing multiple drivers:

         If you want to install multiple cards each connecting to different
         network, you have to install the driver multiple times, each with
         different packet interrupt number.
